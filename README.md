# CSE5335 PROJECT 2

1.I have used mongodb(Mongoid) as my nosql source.Mongodb is one of the most popular databases and i wanted an experience in it.

2.The mapping of database to the app was a bit easy because of the use of mongoid.

3.The html.get was getting an html page instead of json which was difficult to change and also as i had initialy made the app using active records uploading it to heroku was a tough task.

4.The concerns would be making sure that the database objects are correctly mapped and the correct data is extracted.
